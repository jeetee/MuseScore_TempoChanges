# MuseScore TempoChanges
This plugin uses the hidden tempo texts technique to simulate linear tempo changes such as accelerando and ritardando in [MuseScore](https://musescore.org). The technique itself is taken straight out of [the online handbook](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/tempo#ritardando-accelerando).

More info and installation instructions to be found at [the project page on musescore.org](https://musescore.org/project/tempochanges).

Tested with MuseScore 3.0.5
