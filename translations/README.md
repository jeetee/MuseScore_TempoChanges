# MuseScore TempoChanges - Translations

## Brief

This plugin now comes with translations of the dialogs into German, French (thanks to lasconic), Spanish (thanks to jorgk), Italian (thanks to Shoichi) and Simplified Chinese (thanks to David Copperfield), for all other language settings in MuseScore, it remains English. More translations are welcome, just contact us for including them.

Feel free to add Pull Requests for your language

This plugin leverages some of its translations from the MuseScore core program. Your translation should only handle the texts within the TempoChanges context. Leave the other texts unfinished.

## How to use the translation utilities

### Requirement

- These utilities need [QT](https://qt.io) library.

### On Windows {#windows}

#### 1. Adding translation `(.ts)` files

1. Open `generating these ts files.bat` in editor. (e.g, VSCode or Notepad, etc.)
2. Append your new file name to the end of the first line, in the format **locale_**_language-code_**.ts** (e.g, locale_de, local_zh-cn, etc.).
3. Double click on `generating these ts files.bat` or run it in `cmd.exe`.
4. You will find the new file in the same directory as the `generating these ts files.bat`.

#### 2 Start Translating

1. Right click on a `.ts` fils to open with `Qt Linguist.exe`
2. Start translating phrases.

#### 3. Updating `.qm` files

1. Just double click on `generating these qm files.bat` or run it in `cmd.exe`.
2. You will find the new file in the same directory as the `generating these qm files.bat`.

#### 4. Preview Your Translation

Copy and move the whole `MuseScore_TempoChanges` folder to MuseScore `plugin` (You may check the path in MuseScore.exe, from the `main menu`: `File` &rarr; `Preferences...` &gt; `General` tab &gt; `Folders` section) to test the translation.

You may need to adjust some phrases during this process. Then do step 2 and step 3 again.

### On Linux / macOS {#macos-linux}

Use `translation_utility.sh`.

This is a 2-in-1 utility, which enables you to process `.ts` and `.qm` files in an efficient way.

#### 1. Preparation

Before running the script, you have to assign privilege for `translation_utility.sh` using

````bash
sudo chmod u+x [/path/filename]
````

#### 2. Generating new `.ts` / Translating / Updating `.qm`

Then you can double click on it or run it in the Terminal. The instructions are shown in the UI.

After generating .ts files, the `Linguist.app` will automatically launch.

#### 3 Preview Your Translation

Copy and move the whole `MuseScore_TempoChanges` folder to  MuseScore `plugin` (You may check the path in MuseScore.app, from the `top menu`: `MuseScore` &rarr; `Preferences...` &gt; `General` tab &gt; `Folders` section) to test the translation.

You may need to adjust some phrases during this process. Then modify the translation.

#### Cannot use this utility? {#debug}

##### Command not found {#command-not-found}

1. Launch Terminal, type

    ````bash
    sudo vi ~/.bash_profile
    ````

2. Go the the last line of `.bash_profile`, then press _`i`_ to enter the **I**nsert mode of _Vim editor_. Then put following scripts into `.bash_profile`:
_(You might have to modify these scripts to adapt your systems.)_

    ````bash
    # This is an example of standard macOS settings.
    export QTDIR=$PATH:~/Qt5.15.2/5.15.2/clang_64
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$QTDIR/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin
    ````

3. Press `esc` on your keyboard, then type `:wq` to quit from vim editor.
4. Type following command to enable the configurations.

    ````bash
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ````

5. Try to verify with following command .

    ````bash
    qmake
    lupdate
    lrelease
    ````

###### For `zsh` shell on mac

If you are using `zsh` on macOS, after you have done the steps [above](#command-not-found) you will find that you still have to do `source ~/.bash_profile` everytime after a restart of Terminal. Here is the solution:

1. Edit / Create `.zshrc` with 

    ````bash
    sudo vi ~/.zshrc
    ````

2. Add following script

   ````bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ````

3. Press `esc` on your keyboard, then type `:wq` to quit from vim editor.

4. Try to verify with following command .

    ````bash
    qmake
    lupdate
    lrelease
    ````

#### Adaptation

- The macOS / Linux utility (`translation_utility.sh`) has been tested on macOS 12.
- Windows users have to provide the path to lupdate/lrelease manually, so far.
